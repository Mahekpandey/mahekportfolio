            <p>
              Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have evolved from science fiction to scientific reality. 
              As we venture deeper into 2025, the convergence of neuroscience, artificial intelligence, 
              and miniaturized electronics is revolutionizing how we interact with technology and 
              potentially heal neurological conditions.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8">The Current State of BCI Technology</h2>
            <p>
              Modern BCIs have achieved remarkable milestones in both invasive and non-invasive 
              technologies. From helping paralyzed individuals regain motor control to enabling 
              direct brain-to-text communication, the applications are expanding rapidly.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8">Medical Applications</h2>
            <p>
              The medical field has seen the most immediate impact of BCI technology. Treatment of 
              conditions ranging from paralysis to depression has been transformed through direct 
              neural intervention and monitoring.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8">Key Developments</h2>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
              <li>High-resolution neural imaging techniques</li>
              <li>Wireless, miniaturized implants with extended battery life</li>
              <li>Advanced machine learning algorithms for neural signal processing</li>
              <li>Non-invasive BCI solutions for consumer applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8">Ethical Considerations</h2>
            <p>
              As BCI technology becomes more sophisticated, ethical questions about privacy, consent, 
              and the nature of human consciousness come to the forefront. The industry is actively 
              working to establish frameworks for responsible development and deployment.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8">Future Prospects</h2>
            <p>
              The future of BCIs extends beyond medical applications into areas like education, 
              entertainment, and human augmentation. The potential for enhanced human capabilities 
              and direct brain-to-brain communication presents both exciting opportunities and 
              significant challenges.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8">Challenges and Safety</h2>
            <p>
              While the potential benefits are immense, researchers and developers must address 
              critical challenges in long-term biocompatibility, security against neural hacking, 
              and ensuring equitable access to these transformative technologies.
